# How to start off with your first ever project in the world of programming

## Starting a journey is easy, but taking the first step can be a challenge. When I began working on my first few web projects, I had a simple idea and a goal. This helped me finish the project. As I progressed in my programming skills, I lost track of the simple principles that helped me move forward, So here is a reminder to myself and a helpful piece of advice if you’re a developer who is starting out.

### The principles that helped me move forward were:

- ***Ideas don't have to impress the public.***
    
    When I started out, I used to have ideas that weren't unique to the tech I was building them with. For example, I created a clone of an arcade machine with a UI that wasn't very pleasing. Although the game used in it was a cloned project from Github, it helped me grasp the basics of CSS, flexbox, and gradients.

    This project was never appealing to anyone but me. However, it helped me use technology that I would have struggled to use in other projects and progressively find alternatives to it.
    
- ***keep a small start***
    
     It's important to understand that it's okay if your project doesn't have the best UI and features initially. When working on a project, finishing the core of the system is crucial before adding more features. Often, people try to add too many features that exceed the developers' limits.
    
    Building a project can be mentally draining, and if not planned well, it can affect your daily life routine. Therefore, do not add an unnecessary amount of features. Instead, write down your ideas on paper and evaluate if they will take up more time than you have, can be built with the pre-existing knowledge of the technology you know, and if you already have an idea on how to build them. With these factors, you can determine which features to build first.

    one of my project was a movie app. It started off with simple features
    
    - **View information about the movies/shows**
    - **Search for shows and movies**
    - **categorize the movie/shows into different sections**
    
     then after building the app, I was able to add features like 
    
    - **To view different categories of the movies and shows**
    - **Get link of the show in different streaming platform**
    - **See the movie with people you invite**
    - **Share your favorite movies with people**
    - **Watch the movies and shows**
    
    All these features sounded like what an movie app would consist of when it comes out but was added over time
    
- ***Plan it thoroughly***
    
    A Project can consist of different things to build to get the final result you aim, and in order to finish the project you need to plan out on which step to start and how to execute that step, when you start off its easy to just move along with your progress and sometimes this can be draining, as not giving enough space during the development can drain you out possibly even loosing the motivation to continue 
    
    It’s important to know which tools to use and how to use it, More often or not you may come across a time where you feel like using a technology that you heard of but it’s worth knowing why you started, Was it to try out new tech or to build a product. While I’m saying you shouldn’t use new tech, if you’re using make sure you know the inns and outs of the tool

### These are a few things I learned throughout my experience working on projects. It's worth knowing that not every project you work on will be successful, but that doesn't mean you have to stop there.

### Here is a poem to motivate you

**As a new developer, I struggle to learn
My mind races, my nerves churn
The code seems foreign, the concepts obscure
I feel like giving up, that's for sure**

**But deep down, I know that it's worth the fight
To learn this skill, to gain this insight
For with each line of code that I write
I'm building something that could change the world, quite**

**I may stumble, I may fall
But I'll get up and try again, standing tall
For I know that every mistake I make
Is just another step towards my break**

**The journey may be long, the road may be tough
But I won't let my doubts and fears be enough
I'll push through and strive to be the best
Until I've mastered this craft, with finesse**

**And when I finally reach that goal
The sense of achievement will make me whole
For all the struggles, all the tears
Were worth it, in the end, to conquer my fears**

**So I'll keep on learning, day by day
Knowing that my efforts will repay
For as a new developer, I'll one day see
That everything was worth it, in the end, to be me.**
